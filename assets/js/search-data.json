            "content": "Reflection of my 2020 Data Projects (Part II) . - Lessons I learned and want to keep in mind in 2021+ . « Part-I . #6 Every small problem can be BIG . Image by Evgeni Tcherkasski from Pixabay . When we were developing solutions for different projects, we normally start with implementing the functional logic that fulfill the design and we used small volumes of data for validate the functionality. Besides these functional development tasks, there are a few things that deserve our additional attention because they could impact the stability of the system when the system is running in full scale and handles production workload during peak time. . Cloud is a live infrastructure: Cloud is an environment that keeps evolving over time. All cloud vendors are working hard to improve existing services and introduce new capablities in their platform. It also means the services on the cloud will be upgraded every couple months. Though cloud vendors/operators will try to prevent service interruptions and sometime reduce the interruption time to less then one second, it still impacts heavy load systems/componets that happen to have hundreds of data processing tasks at the moment. Some design pattern like Claim-Check Pattern or Queue-Based Load Leveling pattern could help mitigate the impact. | Network Transient Failure: Network is the vessel of modern system, it connects every components and transmits huge information payload in high frequency. Many services and SDKs already have build-in mechanisms to handle network transient failure, but for system that has heavy network traffice we should review how it works in the architecture and consider the needs to adding additional mechanism. The most common practice to handle network failure is to resend and retry the network operation. What need to be pay attention is it’s better to implement a “smarter” retry strategies of system that has huge workload and heavy network operation. Some libraries like Polly (.net core) , Tenacity (python) can help us implement the retry action using advanced algorithm. | Optimize Disk I/O: Understand the distributed file storage system underneath your data solution.For example, check Sharding for Monogo DB, Extents for Azure Data Explorer, Partitioning (bucketing) for Databricks Delta table. | Check how data indexing and partitioning impacts the disk I/O patterns. | Understand the max data access API call for your cloud file storage solution. Remember, reading one file is not an API call, it will require multiple API calls such as directory lookup, check file meta-data, read each chunk of the files. | . | Log exploding: In most systems there will have trace log to help system administrators to monitor and debug the operation status of the system. Pay attention to how these log are been triggered and the log file size growth speed . In large system the log files could increase from KB to multiple GBs in a few hours and drag the performance of the system. Also if the system uses check point files, logging API call, they also need to be checked. | . #7 End-to-End Testing . Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay . Testing is a huge topic and it will/should occupy at least nearly half amount of the developing team’s resources. Since projects always don’t have enough time to do perfect testing, we can only try to spend our limited time on the parts that most likely go wrong and is critical to the system. In data project, we realized tranditional unit test and system integration is not enough to verify the solution quality. . In our projects dev team needs to implement the code logic that retrive, move, clean up, process and store data. To ensure each developed components meets the go-production quality, tranditonal software practices focus on unit testing and integration testing. They can verify if the code logic is correctly and thoughfully implemented. But besides ensure the code is implemented right, another equally important part is to test and make sure the infrastructure is implement right. For example, we want to check: . if the infrastructure can scale properly to handle different data volume | if the computing resource are efficeintly utilized for different workload | if all the tasks can be finished after peak hours | if we caculate the required system resource and make projection in a righ way | if the system boudary/limitation is what we understand | . To know the answer of these questions, We adopted a few techniques: . Mimic Real World and Edge Case Workload: . The simplest way is to deploy the whole environment, the run end-to-end testing using workload that mimic production scenario or scenario we want to test. Unlike web site load testing, this part usually takes efforts to customize and can be an small standalone project by it’s own. To build the workload simulatation solution, Kubernetics is a popular choice, it’s felixable and cost effective. . Leverage Gherkin language and BDD Tools: . “Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project” - behave doc . We want to know how the system performance in different workload, and found it’s easier to describe the workload criteria and expected result in a structure pattern. BDD tools like Cucumber, behave, behat and their script lanaguer Gherkin (a business Readable language for behavior descriptions) match such requirements. Bussiness users can easily change the workload patterns and run the test automatically to verify if the system meet the performance requirments. . Provision Load Testing Environment using CD pipeline parameters : . The other pratice is to integrated load testing environment into CI/CD pipeline, and use a parameter to control the kind of environment the CD pipeline will provision. Due to the tightly integration with infrastructure and relying on features of some cloud PASS services, CI/CD pipeline will become more complicated and requires careful planning. Plan and Integrate the provision of load testing environments in CD pipeline can reduce the number of CD pipeline and easier to keep the environment consistant. . Centralize Performance Metrics and Perpare Dashboard: . Since there are serveral components in the system, each components have different performance metrics which come with quite different measure unit and meaning, it’s easier to have a centralize place to query and view all these metrics. . #8 Measure your Data Drift . Data Drift is a big issue in machine learning system, it means the profile and distribution of the data changed and the previous trained/tested model might not be able to predict result on the new data with same accuracy. But Data Drift not only impacts machine learning prediction, data drift will also impact the data processing pipeline. . When the data processing pipeline are design and tested, it also rely on the understanding of data to optimize the operation. Especially for data aggregation or classification operation, because by nature most data are not evenly distributed, the unbalance data (shew data) will introduce uneven workload that will cause low utilization of system resources. We will need to do some adjustment in order to shuffle data evenly. If data drift, it will break the optimization and could cause even worse unbanlance workload and reduce system efficeincy. . . Considering to add some metrics to monitor data drift if some components in the system is sensitive and will be impacted by data characteristic change. For example, we monitored the running time distribution of some Spark tasks because they are sensitive to data distribution in our scenario. The other common practice is regualrly check statistic distribution of recent data. . #9 Continuous learning with Chaos Engineering . “Chaos engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a software system in production in order to build confidence in the system‘s capability to withstand turbulent and unexpected conditions” - [Principles of Chaos Engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org) . Chaos Engineering is initially proposed by Netflix in 2010 because they wanted a better way to test and improve the reliability of their distributed microservice system. They found the process to finding faults in a distributed system goes beyond the capability of standard application testing. In stead of testing single failure point, the goal of chaos engineering is to generate new knowledge about inter-connections and impacts between components in the system. . image credit: Chaos Engineering: How it Works, Principles, Benefits, &amp; Tools. . Though we have mentioned several key learnings and some of them learned from issues of production system, improve system resilience is a continuous learning journey and there are still a lot parts can be explored and enhanced. Through chaos engineering we can learn the system behavior systematically and understand how it responses to the turbulence in production. For large data project, it definite worth to include the chaos engineering tools and practices not only during system developing but also for long terms system operation. . . In this post I covered topics leaned from several data project I participated in 2020. It’s my 2020 project reflection to reminding myself some key points I should plan and prepare for future data projects. Hoping some of them can also benefit your data projects. .

            "content": "Reflection of my 2020 Data Projects (Part I) . - Lessons I learned and want to keep in mind in 2021+ . Image by Syaibatul Hamdi from Pixabay . 2020 have sunsetted, looking back over it, I had 3 projects that needed to process multiple terabyts data regularly (one of them needs to process hundreds of terebytes data every day) and one project that wanted to apply good MLOps practices on GitHub. Some of the projects have went production and are running on datacenters in different continents to serve worldwide customers. . In this blog post I want to summarize the key practices learned from these projects which I want to remember and keep in mind in 2021. I want to read them each time before a new data project kicks off and make a better plan. . Note! Even for similar workflow, small/medium/large scale projects actually require different architecture and plan differently. This post focus on large scale data project. . #1 Prepare for Data Schema Change . This is a hard fact, but real world data always evolves and data schema will change overtime. Years ago it’s a common practice that we spent a lot of time to negotiate the data schema/contract with data providers and tried to define best schema that can live forever. But we are in a world that data is exponentially growing, more and more data comes from non-traditional OLTP systems. In some projects (especially project that has over several gigabytes data every day) it’s not realistic to assuming we can have stable data format/schema over time and the requests to support varying data schema keeps pop up in system requirements in my 2020 data projects. . There are several techniques that can helps to handle data schema changes, such as: . Bronze, Silver, and Gold architecture | Extract, load, transform | Using data format that support dynamic schema such as JSON, Parquet , and leveraging capablities of NoSQL solutions such as MongoDB, COSMOS DB, Elastic Search, Azure Data Explorer, Delta Lake, Big Query, DynamoDB… | Schema versioning. You can adopt some techiniues like Temporal Patterns, Artifacts are version controlled with application code, Data Mapper, Document Versioning Pattern to implement data versioning | . Most of the techniques actually share similar principles and can complement each other in handling data schema change. The key point is paying some extra attention to it. If someone assumes that they will have a stable schema, it’s better to discuss more on this assumption and validate again since it will impact the foundation of whole system design. . #2 Design for Query &amp; Charting . Image by David Schwarzenberg from Pixabay . A good data system should at least filfills basic query and charting requiremetns of the team. It is very common that data collectors (such as data engineers, people who collect and ingest the data) and data consumers (BI reporter, data analyzer, ML researcher.. ) are from different teams and they don’t understand each others’ languages in projects. This is very normal considering the skill sets required for different roles and the business goals of different teams, but to bring the promised benefits of the whole data system it requires deep engagements from both parties. We saw couple times that technolgies are chose and built based on requirements of one side but that poorly supports the other side’s requirements. . Normally it is easier to figure out the requirements of data collector than the requirements of data consumer because data collectors’ requirements are mostly related to the 3Vs of Big Data - Volume, Variant and Velocity. And they can be quantified with specific numbers in requiremets specification. The data consumers’s requirements are often depends on the business context, problem domain and size, skill set of the data consumers team; it requires some more digging to figure out. . Here are some common factors to consider: . Visualization Tools: Some teams may have strong Excel skill, they are flunent in using power pivot and functions in Excel to generate in-depth interactive report. Some team like the advanced graphical presentation provided by dashboard/reporting tools such as PowerBI, Tableau. Some teams like the powerful programmability in Jupyter Notebook or Shinny. Also most of data platforms will also provide it’s own build-in tool to visualize data. For example, Azure Data Explore provides very handy and power charting capabilities for historical log data and time series data analysis. &lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Residual time series chart in Azure Data Explorer&lt;/p&gt; . | Data Post Processing/Query Tools and Languages: Data consumers will need to further process data to fulfill their analytic requirements. Languages like SQL, R and Python (ok, you can also add Julia) are very common and powerful ones that data analyzers use to further “massage data”. But each analysis domain has it’s own unique data processing pattern. Based on different design purposes, different data platforms also provides their own data query syntax and query engine to support and simplify data post-processing for specific domains. Understand the strength of each platform and choose the best fit one is critical to project’s success. For example, it’s easy to implement complex text filtering and parsing in Elastic Search, but it’s hard to implement complex data join and aggregation in it. The other example is Azure Data Explorer, it focus on historical log data analytics and rovides very powrerful Kusto Query Lanaguage to simply log parsing, aggreation, data join and semi-structure data processing. It is one of my favor query languages. . | Performance goal and Limitation to retrieve insights from “Big Data”: Processing large volumes of data is not easy, different solution applies different strategies to achieve their performance goal. They use different index algorithm , in-memory computing, cluster resource allocation, file storage structure, data compression type …etc to archive it’s performance goal. These strageties will also come with some limitations like “limitation of concurrent users”, “unbalance computing resource allocation”, “required huge memory caches”, “data paging support”…etc. Review the pro and con of different solutions and test them in the project’s key data query scenarios. . | . Both data collecotrs and data consumers are key stakeholder of a data project. In solution design phase, it’s helpful to have deep engagement with both two teams. Spending a little more time on how the data query pattern looks like and consider the data analysis tools that are suitable for users, then you will have a bright outlook for the system. . #3 Balance the workload of each resources . image credit: Rob Leane -Den of Geek UK. . When we were working on small or medium size data project, we implemented the solution using one or two key technologies such as Databricks or Azure Data Explorer. These technologies come with some default capabilities to ingest, manage and query data. We focused on providing properly configuration on these platforms. . However when we worked on large scale projects, in stead of relying on build-in capabilities, we found we need to re-architect the system to further distribute the computation workloads to different components of the system. We need to spend more time thinking about how to make the data more “swallowable” for the data platform. “Swallowable” could mean things like reduce the data fragmentation, easier to build index, remove dirty data, remove duplicated data… etc. . The workload distribution process is also a process to find the balance of each components. You need to think about: . Size of your batch and how it impacts latency and memory consumption | choose different data formats, consider it’s impact to data serialize/un-serialize time and disk I/O | decide where to filter, split, aggregate data so the next component can reduce workload and also simplify management and configuration complexicty. | It also related to the max scale out/in capabilities of each components so all the data input and output velocity of these components are within the bandwidth of it’s connected components. | . For large scale project, the righ solution will be the tasks are well distrubuted and the workload is balanced among all key components. So the designed system can have room growth it’s capacity, handle peak time traffic and prepare for future buiness growth. . #4 Wow, there are duplicated data . This is another common issue when we process large amount of data. Data could be duplicated for dozens of reason. It could be the data source sent twice because of network issue; it could be some part of the data processing pipeline partially failed and the system is trying to resume from latest checkpoint; it could be the underneath message service only guarantee at least once…etc. . Image by Martin Pyško from Pixabay . We need to evaluate the business impact and the cost we want to pay for mitigating the issue. Common strategies to handle duplicated data are: . Ingestion Time Check : We can have ingestion time check by adding data processing log or checkpoint file. Then all the ingestion operation need to verify the log/checkpoint file before process the data. | Settling Basin Filter : In this strategy, the data will be put into an temporary storage/table, and then they will be compared with recently ingested data to make sure the data is not duplicated. | Query Time Check : In some systems, a few duplicated data can be ignored in most use cases (eg. website user login log for analyzing user demographic/ geographical distribution), and only few of its use cases required duplicated data check. For such scenario, we can check duplicated data at query time for only required use cases, then we can reduce the system cost for de-duplicated data check. | Under Some Threshold, Ignore It : It’s best solution if the business context allows it. De-duplication operations usually occupy certain amount of system resources and impact system performance. In large data processing system it’s very costly to implement it. It will helpful if we can just ignore it when it doesn’t impact the business goad. | . Besides above strategies to handle duplicated data, one other point is to understand where the duplicated data comes from. Which part of the system or infrastructure services provides at least once and which part can support exactly once. If the system use checkpoint to resume the failed operation, try to understand how it works. . #5 Understanding of Core Technologies . Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay . This point should be needless to say, but I add the point here not just because it’s fundamental but also it could take consider mount of time to understand the design philosophy and available configuration parameters of different data platform. Many of the settings could impact each others, we should keep in mind that planning enough time to learn, test and verify best configuration setting is required. . For example, in the core technologies I used in these projects, here are some key configurations that need to check, caculate and test: . Databricks Number of Cores | Number of Memory | Duration of Job, Stage, Tasks | Fair scheduler Pool | Structured Steaming : max-files, max-size per trigger | Shuffle Partitions | Shuffle Spill (memory) | . | Azure Data Explorer Ingestion MaximumBatchingTimeSpan | MaximumNumberOfItems | MaximumRawDataSizeMB | . | Capacity Policy Ingestion capacity | Extents merge capacity | Extents purge rebuild capacity | Export capacity | Extents partition capacity | Materialized views capacity policy | . | . | Azure Functions (Python) FUNCTIONS_WORKER_PROCESS_COUNT | Max instances when Functions scale out | Queue Trigger batchSize | newBatchThreshold | . | HTTP Trigger maxConcurrentRequests | . | . | . » Part-II .

            "title": "Lessons learned from building a large scale historical data analysis system using Azure Data Explorer - Part 2",
            "content": "[This is the part II of the topic, you can check Part I if you haven’t.] . I have mentioned 5 basic lessons I learned from my recent project that has hundreds of terabytes data. In this part II I would like to share a few more advanced lessons. . Lesson 6 Consider guiding users to submit the right queries and think about having some data process running on the client-side . Azure Data Explorer(ADX) is designed to process a huge amount of data. It can efficiently handle hundreds of terabytes data or even petabytes data. Data is a very valuable asset especially when you have a lot of them. These data can support users to find hidden business trends, detect anomaly events, identify correlation things from these data. . However with so much data in your system’s back yard, you also need to make sure users will access them in the right way because users might not have a good sense of how much data they are trying to process. So we should guide and prevent users from unconsciously trying to retrieve 100 gigabytes of data to their web browser or trying to get 1 million records to their client just for showing a line chart. Helping users to use aggregation and return data in just enough granularity for their business needs can largely reduce system workload and improve performance. . Also you should consider using the user’s client to share some data process loading of ADX. For example, users might want to sort the result by some specific columns, this can be easily implemented on the client-side. It’s also easier to do data paging in client slides then resubmit queries for each page. . In ADX it provides some mechanisms such as result set size, request execution time to prevent system resource been occupied by some bad queries. You can also use these mechanisms to prevent some queries to take too many resources from the system or grant more resources to some special queries. . Lesson 7 Check some advance table policy . To further provide better query performance, ADX now provides some new more advanced configuration in Table policies such as Data partitioning policy and RowOrder policy. If you need to improve query response time, they are options you can try. But using them carefully, they will increase data ingestion time and consume more computing resources. Also, partition has some side effect on extents management and need more resources to run the policy. . The other consideration is the choice between putting data in different tables or different databases. This choice will impact the following areas in system design: . Data Access Control | Admin node workload | Data sharing mechanism | . Users should consider putting data in different databases when you want to have more flexibility to manage and share data. Also when the data volume is big, having multiple databases can enjoy the benefit of having different Admin nodes for each database and then have more resources to maintaining data metadata and perform transactions. . Lesson 8 Check Server loading and very very carefully tuning some of them if needed. . To handle data ingestion and query workload, ADX has several mechanisms to balance the resources used to support different operation and maintenance workload. . For data management operations, you can use .show capacity to quickly show the resources utilization of these core capabilities. . . In most cases the official recommendation is just leave the setting as is, the default setting should be able to handle most of the situations and they will keep each resource utilization balanced. If in some cases if you thought you really need to change these values, it’s also recommended to at least check and ask in stackoverflow to have some experts to double verify it. . Also you might also want to check the Extents number and its growth in your system. Extents are the core data allocation unit within ADX, ADX will try to organize it in the best way to fulfill both data ingestion needs and data query needs. If for some reason too much extends are created, it will increases the loading of ADX admin node and potential will impact system performance. For a large system it’s a good practice to keep an eye on it. . . Lesson 9 Optimize the KQL query plan for the long queries and review cache policy . Though we mentioned how different query syntax could impact query performance in Understand and test KQL query performance session of Part I, here I want to talk about KQL query plan. . In Kusto Explorer, there is a build-in tool named Query Analyzer which provides extra information on how your KQL runs. You can use them to understand how the query actually being executed, if your query can run in parallel on all the nodes, if the query filter efficiently reduces data retrieval volumes or if the data join. . . . Also by design initially (before the cluster is running) all the data are stored on cold storage (Azure Blob storage). When the cluster starts, cluster nodes will load all these hot data (defined by Cache policy) data into local SSD and memory so they become hot data and can be quickly accessed. Review the cache hit rate of popular queries and check if the cache policy is properly defined can potentially have a good boost of performance. . Lesson 10 Review Security Setting . Last but not least, Security. ADX can use both Azure AD and Microsoft Account (MSAs) as the identity providers. And we also need to have a plan for user authentication and application authentication. . There are different security roles in ADX. It’s good to review the security setting in your system and make sure you have separation of concerns for your account and security planning. . . Azure Data Explorer is a very powerful tool for analyzing historical log or telemetries data. In many cases we saw it provide a more cost-effective and more powerful query tool to fulfill users’ business needs. . Above are 10 lessons I thought are important when implementing a large scale data analysis platform when using Azure Data Explorer. The best way to understand the detail of them is still read through the official documents. But these lessons might provide you a quick bird’s-eye view of what you should check and look. .

            "content": "Recently I had an opportunity to participate in another data project that also uses Azure Data Explorer(ADX) as the core data process and store engine. In this project we used ADX to ingest and process more than half of petabytes data. Like most projects we were under some time and resource constraints, and also encountered a few unexpected technical challenges due to the constraints. Though we couldn’t implement the system using the best-optimized architecture (it will take too much time than the project was allowed), we still managed to achieve the project goal. It’s an exciting and fun journey and here are a few lessons we learned. . Lesson 1 Select proper SKU . There are couples different SKU options for ADX, some are more CPU optimized like D-Series (D-series, Ds-series) VM, they have more powerful CPU; some are more storage optimized like Ls-Serious VM, they are equipped with larger SSD to achieve more I/O performance. Have a testing plan to test the key user query patterns on these different type of VMs and check which one is best for your query workload can benefit the project in the long run. . . Lesson 2 Check different ingestion options. . In Azure Data Explorer, it supports several different ingestion solutions, the decision will depend on the purpose and stage of your development. You can check here for detail information of these solutions. . It’s better to read through the official document, understand their differences before making a decision. Meanwhile, here are a few thumb rules: . For query testings, verifying scripts, tables, you can use Inline ingestion (push) | For ad-hoc feature engineering, data cleaning, you can use Ingest from query | For ingestion testing, create some volumes of data, you can use Ingest from storage (pull) | For production ingestion pipeline testing, I normally will use Queued ingestion. | . In addition to the above basic ingestion options, you can also check the following options based on your scenario and environment. . Ingest from storage using Event Grid subscription | Ingest from Event Hub | Ingest from IoT Hub | . And there is a new ingestion option One-Click Ingestion which are just been announced in Microsoft Build 2020. . Eeek, a lot of choices. :p . Lesson 3 Have a clean ingestion pipeline . Normally when trying to ingest data into a data repository, we might need to do some data pre-process such as check file format, clean dirty data, do a few data transformation, etc. Azure Data Explorer provides some of these capabilities through User-defined function and update policy. You can use these mechanisms to quickly perform some data pre-process tasks within ADX without setup extra computing services to handle it. . While these are convenient ways to massage data, it will occupy ADX’s resources and potentially introduce more data fragmentation. There are complex mechanisms within ADX to optimize the resources it has, maintains and organize data in its storage and keep the system in a healthy status. . Under the condition that data ingestion volume is big, these data pipeline activities could impact the resource available for ADX to handle queries or do internal housekeeping tasks. You might need to carefully monitor ADX status and do a few fine tunes on its configuration. While I did use these mechanisms for other smaller-scale projects and love it, it is still a better practice just to keep the data pre-process tasks outside of ADX in large scale project, at least before you are very familiar each internal mechanisms within ADX.) . Data Factory, Databricks, Azure Functions/App services, AKS, HDInsight provide good foundational capabilities to pre-process data. . . In my git project I shared some codes that I used Azure Functions to do Queued ingestion. . Lesson 4 Evaluate the horizontal scale (# of servers) needed . When planning system roll-out, a solid estimation of the number of servers needed and a well-estimated expansion plan for the future is important. It can also help save costs by preventing under-utilization and provide valuable information for system design. System scale out/ horizontal scaling is one of the core capabilities that we can make sure the system can be adaptive to the workload and provide just enough resource to the users. In our test, one of the key ADX features that users love is it can provide almost linear performance growth when scaling out. ADX also provides non-destructive services when scaling out. . . It’s suggested that you should run a few workload simulations and test about how the scale-out can increase your system capabilities. . . ACI and AKS can be helpful if you want to simulate the system workload. . Lesson 5 Understand and test KQL query performance . One of the key strengths of ADX is its powerful query language Kusto Query Language (KQL). Like most other data query languages, some query operators in KQL are similar, give you the same result but could have a huge difference in performance. . It’s always good the validate what’s your key query scenarios and try how different query syntax impact the query performance. . . You can review the query performance using Kusto.Explorer tool or ADX Web UI. You can also use .show queries operator to review the performance of historical queries. . . . .. to be continued .

            "content": "Azure Data Explorer Introduction . Azure Data Explorer (ADX, aka Kusto) is a very powerfully log/historical data analysis platform provided by Microsoft that powers several key Azure services such as Application Insight, Azure Monitor, Time Series insight. It is designed to handle huge amounts of historical data and can ingest and process Peta-bytes of data every day with little efforts to set up the infrastructure. On February 7, 2019, Microsoft GA the service to customers. . . One of the features that I particularly like is its query language KQL (Kusto Query Language), KQL combines the concept of SQL query and data pipeline. In real project experience, it is very powerful and saved me a lot of time to get the query result in the structure that my projects need. You can check this official tutorial that introduces KQL’s key concept and following is an example about how to query data 12 days ago and do count aggregation very 30 minutes. It’s a very popular bin count pattern when analyzing data on time dimension. In the query we use “mv-expand” operator to make sure there is still a record presents the 0 count even the system has no data in that 30 minutes range. “mv-expand” is also very useful when you are parsing and expanding JSON data. . let StartTime=ago(12d); let StopTime=ago(11d); T | where Timestamp &gt; StartTime and Timestamp &lt;= StopTime | summarize Count=count() by bin(Timestamp, 30m) | union ( // 1 range x from 1 to 1 step 1 // 2 | mv-expand Timestamp=range(StartTime, StopTime, 30m) to typeof(datetime) // 3 | extend Count=0 // 4 ) | summarize Count=sum(Count) by bin(Timestamp, 30m) // 5 . . You can also easily generate a graphic chart to visualize your query result through “render” operator. In the previous query, you can add “| render timechar” to generate the following graph which represents the trend of how many records we have every 30 mins eleven days ago. . |render timechart . . For data consumers ADX also provides various client tool that users can use to create different kind of query, graphic chart and dashboard. The tool that support ADX includes : . ADX WebUI | Kusto Desktop Client tool | PowerBI | Excel | Jupyter Notebook(using KQLMagic extension) | Grafana | Spark . | . Azure Data Explorer Access Control . In the access control part, ADX supports user authentication through Microsoft Accounts (MSAs) and Azure AD account. Microsoft Account is non-organizational user accounts, these accounts normally use email like hotmail.com, live.com, outlook.com. Azure AD account is created through Azure AD or another Microsoft cloud service such as Office 365. It will be tight to an Azure AD tenant and is the preferred method for authenticating to ADX. Most enterprise users should use AAD account for authentication. Here has more information about ADX access control. . Like most Azure services, you can manage user accounts and their access to ADX through “Access control” function within Azure Portal. . . The other way to manage it is through KQL query. You can run the following command to check the accounts and roles that can access ADX database. . .show database [Database Name]] principals . You can read ADX Security roles management session to understand more about using KQL to manage user access control. . ADX authentication is also the part I would like to share a few troubleshooting tips which I learned from projects. . Azuer Data Explorer cross-tenant access issue . Ideally if you login your PC with Azure AD account that in the same tenant of the Azure subscription which been used to create the ADX cluster, then everything should work good and you can just management user access in Azure Portal. However it’s not always the case, users can come from different organizations and partners. Here are a few ways we used to check and fix the issues. . The problem: . Grant a user to access ADX in Azure Portal UI. And the user can assess ADX in Azure portal. But he/she but couldn’t access it in ADX Web UI and Kusto Explorer, PowerBI, Excel or other client tools. . What happened is when you grant a new user to access ADX, if the user’s account comes from a different tenant, in ADX it will create a new Principle Object Id in its tenant. If the user access ADX in Azure portal, the user’s account already switches to the right tenant so there is no problem accessing ADX. But if users from different tenant try to use other client tools, these client tools will use default tenant and which might not match the tenant that ADX is using. . How to fix the issue . Solution A: Force ADX WebUI and Kusto Explorer to use not ADX’s tenant . ADX WebUI . Default ADX WebUI has URL like . https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/[cluster name].[data center] . You can force it to recognize a user’s login tenant by add &amp;tenant=[tenant id] to the URL. So it will look like . https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/[cluster name].[data center]?tenant=[tenant id] . | Kusto Explorer Client . Instead of default connection by specifying ADK cluster URL, You need to use advanced query. . | . . The connection string will be like: . Data Source=https://[Cluster Name].[Data Center].kusto.windows.net;AAD Federated Security=True;AAD User ID=[User&#39;s AAD account(E-mail)];Authority Id=[User&#39;s AAD account tenant ID ] . . Solution B: Grant user using ‘right’ tenant id and account id . As said by default user granted in Azure portal will using ADX’s tenant id and create a new account object id. If you want to add a user from a different tenant, the suggested way will be to grant users using KQL. . You can grant a new user with different roles like . .add database [Database Name] [Role Name] (&#39;aaduser=[User AAD account id];[User AAD tenant id]&#39;) &#39;Notes for the account, eg. User Name&#39; . Get AAD account object id &amp; tenant id using Azure CLI . To get user’s AAD account object id, you can use Azure CLI command : . | . az ad signed-in-user show . To get the user’s tenant ID, you can use Azure CLI command : . az account list . Get AAD account object id &amp; tenant id in Azure portal . You can also find AAD account object id &amp; tenant id in Azure Active Directory service of Azure portal. . | . . Get AAD account object id &amp; tenant id in ADX Web UI . If you login using ADX Web UI, actually the error message contains the AAD user account id and tenant id. The message will be looks like following . Error message : action Principal ‘aaduser=[AAD accound id];[ AAD tenant id ]’ is not authorized to perform operation . It’s another easy way to get the information you needed. . | . ADX is a very powerful platform that provides interactive analysis capabilities which can handle huge amount of historical log data with little infrastructure maintenance efforts. Because most enterprises use Azure AD to grant users access, helping these tips can save you sometime when you have cross tenant access requirements. .",
